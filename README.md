This is where I will store all my playable games. I might even put some in that aren't very playable.  Most of these will only work on windows systems.
So about half of these games are unfinished. 
I do intend to work on them again. 
I have found that the ones that get finished, are usually the simple arcade games.
Probably the game in here that I spent the most time on is probably either Sorf mobiler or TimeGuy.
They are very diffrent in completeness though.
The first verion I uploaded has six levels, but recent updates make it nearly imposible to beat the second.
TimeGuy requires a game pad.
NeighborhoodTrebuchet has a small glitch that I just have kinda ignored because it works fine with out fixing it. 
When you click to launch rocks, make sure to not click the sky. It senses if you click something, and the sky doesn't register for it, so just
click something else.

The game I am currently working on is the dog fighter. It has come together really fast and has taught me a lot about data management.
